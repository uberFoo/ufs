//! A different sort of file system: *uberFS*
//!
//! # File System Structure
//!
//! ## Blocks
//!
//! The blocks are fixed-size, and uniform for a given file system.  Blocks contain nothing more
//! than the raw data that is written to them.  Put another way, there is no metadata _about_ the
//! block stored in the block _itself_.  Rather, metadata blocks contain information about blocks
//! that make up files and directories.
//!
//! ### Working with Blocks
//!
//! Blocks storage is abstracted by the [BlockStorage] trait.  There are implementations that
//! support storing blocks as files in on a host file system, in memory, and over the network.
//!
//! The BlockStorage trait has methods for reading (`read_block`) and, writing (`write_block`)
//! blocks to implemented media.
//!
//! ### Block 0
//!
//! The first block is the file system is special.  It contains the `BlockMap`, described below.
//!
//! ## Block Map
//!
//! The block map maintains a mapping from a block's number to a block's type. It also contains
//! metadata about the blocks themselves. It's stored in starting at block 0, and is the first thing
//! loaded, when a file system is initialized, by the `BlockStorage` implementation.
//!
//! ## Metadata
//!
//!
//! ## Addressing
//!
//! Each file system has a unique ID, as discussed elsewhere. This ID forms a namespace for block
//! numbers. Each block has a number, assigned by the file system starting at 0, and increasing
//! until the file system is full.  Note that this does not preclude growing the file system.
//!
//! ## Block Lists
//!
//! A block list is how data (files, directories, metadata, etc.) is stitched together from
//! disparate blocks. Below the discussion degrades to talking about files, but it is equally
//! applicable to other entities stored on the file system.
//!
//! As files change, the history of it's contents is preserved via a block list. Blocks may be
//! inserted into, and deleted from a block list, and a history is maintained. It is imagined that a
//! user may intentionally delete an entire file, or some portion of it's history, but that is not
//! the default use case. To this end blocks are for the most part write-once.
//!
//! Blocks are encrypted. Period. One of the main intentions of *uberFS* is privacy, and that's
//! simply not possible without encryption. Additionally, the data must be preserved, and secured
//! from bit-rot, intentional tampering, etc.
//!
//! Blocks are encrypted using an AEAD algorithm, and it's MAC is stored, along with the block
//! number in a block list.  Prior to encryption each block is hashed with SHA256, and it's hash
//! is also stored in the block list.  While this may seem a bit belt-and-suspenders, it allows
//! validation of files based on either encrypted or clear-text blocks, and ensures against
//! man-in-the-middle attacks on remote blocks.
//!
//! A block list is thus an array of tuples that include an *operation* (insert, or delete), a
//! *block address* (note that this allows for files comprised of blocks distributed across file
//! systems), a plain-text *hash*, and an encryption *MAC*.
//!
//! # API
//!
//! There are a number of services that need to be built on top of this library, and likely as not
//! quite a few that I have not yet conceived. Therefore the API needs flexibility and generality.
//!
//! The services that I have in mind include:
//!
//!  * A remote *Block* service with a RESTful API. The purpose of this service is to provide an
//! online block storage, with read/write capability. Encrypted blocks may be read, and written by
//! remote file systems.
//!
//!  * A remote *execution* service that, with appropriate authentication, will execute WASM code
//! against files, returning possibly transformed information based on the underlying data. This is
//! distinct from the block service, but may be integrated into the same.
//!
//! * A FUSE-based file system adaptor to mount an *uberFS* as a native file system.
//!
//! * A web-based view for *uberFS*.
//!
//! ## Block Server
//!
//! The block service's main contribution is distributing blocks. It may or may not decrypt blocks,
//! depending on whether proper authentication is provided. It is however intended to utilize TLS
//! in order to preserve encryption in the event that it is returning decrypted blocks.

//! ### Required End-Points
//!
//! * `read_block(number)`
//! * `write_block(number)`
//!
